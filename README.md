uAudio connects directly to the Unity3D Audio Clip/Source system, perfect for Visualizers or immersive environments.

No need to embed or convert music files into your project. uAudio decodes and processes compressed audio live.

uAudio loads music files fast(less then 100 ms) with a tiny memory foot print(less then 8mb). uAudio it self is less then 3mb.

uAudio_Stream includes a Beta threading option to buffer your WebStream on a non-Unity thread so it will not slow down your render loop.
